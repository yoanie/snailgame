# Snurder Game

A snail’s life is already hard enough as it is, but when a human floods your home with water and chops down the familiar blades of grass around you, your murderous desires boil over into reality. In Snurder Game, the player explores the local human’s home with the intent to kill in a cutesy yet challenging top-down puzzle game.
